# How It Works
Write a Pytest suite for your Grad Café analytics application that verifies
The Flask Analysis page loads and renders required components
The “Pull Data” and “Update Analysis” buttons behave correctly (including doing nothing when a pull is in progress)
Analysis outputs are labeled and percentages are shown with two decimals
New rows are correctly written into PostgreSQL using the Required schema
Ensure 100% test coverage and automatically runs tests using Github Actions.
Documents the service with Sphinx: include developer setup, architecture, API reference for your modules, and a “How to run tests” page; publish the HTML to Read the Docs
